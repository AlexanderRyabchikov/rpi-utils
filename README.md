# Raspberry-Pi Utilities 

This is a collection of things to do with the Raspberry Pi that are made available
to the community in the hope they are useful to others.

## ArchBuild

ArchBuild will build a new root filesystem for the Raspberry Pi. Use it instead of
the official image if you want to tweak the installation.

## Kernel

Building a custom kernel.

## Disk

Some tools that can help with managing disks (or other storage devices, e.g: sd card)
and disk images.

## ScrapBook

A collection of notes, scripts and other things that may be of interest. Basically,
anything I have found useful will end up in here if they don't fit in anywhere
else. See the ScrapBook CONTENTS file details of what's there.

## Colophon
